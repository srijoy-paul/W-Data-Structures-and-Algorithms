# OOP(Object Oriented Programming)
### Classes
### Objects

**Four Pillars**
#### Encapsulation
 - Binding/clubbing/wrapping up of the data members and member functions together in a single module is called encapsulation.
 - It promotes data hiding.
 ```
 ex: keeping the sensative variables under private access specifiers
 ```

#### Inheritance
  **Types of Inheritance**
  - Single Inheritance
    - Parent -> child
  - Multi-level Inheritance
    - Parent -> Parent ->child
#### Abstraction
 - Abstraction can be implemented by some ways:
 1. Using access specifiers ( using which we can hide necessary data and make visible or display other data)
 2. Abstract classes
   - Basically, abstract class acts as a blueprint/Interface for other classes, 
   - it can't be instantiated(object)
   - it can be inherited
   - and, all the methods of the abstract class should be defined in the class derieving the abstract class.
   - whenever in a class, virtual function is there, the class becomes as a abstract class.
