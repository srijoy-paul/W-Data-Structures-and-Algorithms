     * the concept of void pointer is like that, it points to such a mem location which has not type, so and technically, we can point a void pointer to any type of memory location.
     * see the example void pointer is pointed to the int type mem variable location, and it stores the address of that.
     * A void pointer (void*) is a generic pointer type that can hold the address of any data type. However, it cannot be dereferenced directly because the compiler doesn't know what type of data it points to.
     *
     * Void Pointers Lack Type Information:
       The compiler doesnâ€™t know how to interpret the data at the memory address stored in ptr (is it an int, float, etc.?).
     Direct Dereferencing is Invalid:
       You cannot use *ptr directly because the type is unknown. You must explicitly cast the void pointer to the correct type before dereferencing.
